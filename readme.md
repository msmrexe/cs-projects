# CS Learning Projects

This repository is intended for my personal storing and sharing of select computer science projects (*theoretical or practical*) that I have dabbled in as I learned and practiced more in this abundant field. Clearly, one can lose much of their work to damaged hard drives (*oh, the tragedy of life*).

But for any who might be interested in reviewing or using any of my work, feel completely free to step in.

## Disclaimer

The files are purely experiential and may vary from university assignments, course projects, or additional computer science related interests. So **be warned, dear reader, that not all are *pretty*.**
