# CS Learning Projects
This repository is intended for my personal storing and sharing of select computer science projects (theoretical or practical) that I have dabbled in as I learned more and more, since I unfortunately lost much of my work to damaged hard drives (*oh, the tragedy of life*). But for any who might be interested in reviewing or using any of my work, feel completely free to step in.

## Disclaimer
The files are purely experiential and may vary from university assignments, course projects, or additional computer science related interests. So **be warned, dear reader, that not all are *pretty*.**
