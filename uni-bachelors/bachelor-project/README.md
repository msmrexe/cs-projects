# Project Overview

This computer science bachelor’s project, which encompassed both a learning and implementation phase, began in Feb 2023. Due to limited prior knowledge in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Bioinformatics, the project was initially structured as a learning path for the use of DL in Pathway Analysis with a potential implementation goal to be refined over time. After a semester of foundational study, a presentation was given to outline the acquired insights and propose a four-step implementation roadmap, marking the conclusion of the learning phase.

With a clearer direction established, the first step of the roadmap was selected as the project’s final objective for summer 2023, to be followed-up after graduation in case of further interest. At the end of the project, a detailed handbook was created for the more complex of the two technologies, serving as a comprehensive guide for future students.

## Project Goals

- **Learning Goal:** Understanding the Usage of Machine Learning in Cell Signalling Pathway Analysis (Seminar)
- **Implementation Goal:** Developing A Practical Guide for Identifying Differentially Expressed Genes (Guidebook)

## Foundational Study

To undrestand the details and methods of using Deep Learning in indentification of impacted cell signalling pathways during the learning stage, a series of articles, book chapters, and courses were selected after research and studied and analysed in detail over the course of 4 months. The material is available in the relevant folder. The main topics include:

- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Support Vector Machines
- Cell Biology
- Bioinformatics Basics
- Gene Expression and DEGs
- Gene Expression Measurement Technologies
- DEG Analysis Tools
- Cell Signalling Pathways
- Pathway Analysis Methods
- Example Use of ML in Pathway Analysis
