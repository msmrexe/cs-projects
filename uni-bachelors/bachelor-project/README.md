# Project Overview

This computer science bachelor’s project, which encompassed both a learning and implementation phase, began in winter 2023. Due to limited prior knowledge in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Bioinformatics, the project was initially structured as a learning path for the use of DL in Pathway Analyis with a potential implementation goal to be refined over time. After a semester of foundational study, a presentation was given to outline the acquired insights and propose a four-step implementation roadmap, marking the conclusion of the learning phase.

With a clearer direction established, the first step of the roadmap was selected as the project’s final objective for summer 2023, to be followed-up after graduation in case of further interest. At the end of the project, a detailed handbook was created for the more complex of the two technologies, serving as a comprehensive guide for future students.

## Project Goals
- **Learning Goal:** Understanding the Usage of Machine Learning in Cell Signalling Pathway Analysis (Seminar)
- **Implementation Goal:** Practical Methods for Analysing Differentially Expressed Genes (Guidebook)
