# Project Overview

For the final project of the Bachelor’s Cryptography course (2022 | Semester 4011) at the University of Isfahan, students were asked to select a topic of interest from the course material and conduct research to produce an article detailing their findings and presenting their personal insight on the solution to one of the encountered challenges in the field of study. This project focused on assessing and enhancing the security of P2P systems using hash functions due to their widespread practicality and the intriguing nature of P2P networks.


## Topic

Evaluating the Feasibility of Proving Authenticity and Data Integrity for Peer-to-Peer Data Transfer Systems Using Hash Functions


## Description

This project explores the challenges of ensuring authenticity and data integrity in peer-to-peer (P2P) data transfer systems and explores a solution to increased security through the implementation of hash functions.

The article begins by providing an overview of P2P systems and the potential vulnerabilities in maintaining data authenticity and integrity. It then explores a solution inspired by developing frameworks, detailing a structured method for generating and verifying hashes for data blocks. The choice of incorporated hash function is further discussed using a comparison of common hash algorithms including SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3, and highlighting of each algorithm’s strengths and limitations in securing P2P data transmission.
