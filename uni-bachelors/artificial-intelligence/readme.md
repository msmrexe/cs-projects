# Project Overview

One of the primary projects for the Bachelor's course in Artificial Intelligence (2023 | Semester 4012) at the University of Isfahan involved rewriting and completing the options for a Pacman game agent using various search algorithms. The project was implemented in Python using the game module.

## Topic

Implementation of AI Search Algorithms in A Pacman Game Using Python

## Description

The DFS, BFS, UCS, and A* algorithms were implemented to guide Pacman from the starting point to the goal. BFS and A* were then used to help Pacman locate food in the corners of the game map. Modified game files used for implementing these algorithms are provided separately in the folder.
